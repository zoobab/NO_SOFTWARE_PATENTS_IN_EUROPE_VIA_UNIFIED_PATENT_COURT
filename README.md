# NO Software Patents in Europe via the Unified Patent Court!

## We are protesting against software patents in Europe.

## Software patents are an insult to the profession, have a negative effect on jobs, and are promoting patent trolls.

## We are asking our politicians to renegotiate the UPC and put back the European Court of Justice (CJEU) as having a say on patent law, and the last word over software patents!

## Vote in the Bundestag coming

## Give money to crowdfund a constitutional complaint!
